# What knowledge or skills did you learn?

There's a lot of things I learned over the course of this culminating project, especially in terms of product (not just project) management, leading people towards a goal or many goals and communicating how I believe aspects of the project or development roadmap should be chagned as well as listening and incorporating team member's ideas.

In addition, before I wasn't as familiar with any of the frameworks because I hadn't completed a large project or anything using those frameworks, so my knowledge of how to use them properly, dependencies, libraries etc. were very limited.

Through this experience I've been able to develop not only my hard skills in writing clean readable code, documenting code, but also been able to develop my soft skills in communicating with the VP, with Mr. Lee during the interviews and with my team daily to ensure the direction of the project was aligned with our goals. 

For example, I've noticed that I was able to present more and more without being nervous or needing to prepare all that much, which I think will carry forward into the future since a lot of work requires presenting and communicating with different people on a daily basis. Being able to voice my ideas or present them in a way that is easily digestable by other people will go a long way.

On the language side, I did not know that you could destructure so many things in Javascript. In addition Javascript has functions within functions within functions which makes for a very interesting but completely readable code. 

Ex.

```js
MongoObj.find({}, (err, obj) => {
  // something
}).then((res) => {
  res.get(() => {});
});
```

In addition, Javascript has some things that are also only Javascript. Comparisons use `===` and `!==` to compare exact values while `==` and `!=` compare the value types. Not only that but the style guides for Javascript are endless and it also varies from framework to framework. 

The main takeaway from the language I learned was that it is incredibly flexible and high level. At least for me, I found it really easy to understand because it was so abstracted and quick to implement, hence a quicker development time and easier when we need to change directions.
